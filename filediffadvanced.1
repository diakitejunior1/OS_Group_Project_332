.SH SYNOPSIS
filediffadvanced <mode> <file1> <file2>

Modes:
  text     Line-by-line text comparison
  binary   Byte-by-byte binary comparison

.SH DESCRIPTION
filediffadvanced is a simple file comparison tool implemented using
POSIX system calls such as open(), read(), lseek(), and stat().
It supports two comparison modes:

  • text   Compares two files line-by-line and prints the line numbers
           that are different.

  • binary Compares two files byte-by-byte and prints the number of
           differing bytes.

The program also measures execution time using gettimeofday().

.SH EXAMPLES
Compare two text files:
  filediffadvanced text a.txt b.txt

Compare two binary files:
  filediffadvanced binary bin1 bin2

.SH ERRORS
The program reports errors for:
  • Missing arguments
  • File open failures
  • stat() failures
  • fdopen() conversion errors
  • read() errors during binary diff

.SH NOTES
Requires a POSIX environment (macOS, Linux, or Windows WSL).
